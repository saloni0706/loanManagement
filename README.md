Testing the Endpoints (Sample)

  Request body:
  {
    "username": "john.doe@example.com",

  }

  {
    "loanAmount": 50000,
    "interestRate": 5.5,
    "durationMonths": 12,
    "loanPurpose": "Home Renovation"
  }

- Make a Repayment: POST /repayments/make

Assumptions & Limitations

- Interest is calculated using simple interest formula.
- JWT authentication is basic and for demo purpose (no refresh token).
- Overdue detection logic assumes daily repayment schedule (custom logic can be added).
- Admin/User roles are determined via Customer.role field.
